<center><h2>What is Gigify?</h2></center>
<center><h3>Gigify is an artist discovery tool.</h3></center>

<center><p>I've always been an avid concert-goer, but noticed myself taking less time to research music as life grew busier. I wanted a tool that would not only tell me what's playing in my area, but seamlessly create a playlist to see if any of the gigs interested me.</p></center>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p class="item-description">It populates a list of events based on a user's local Songkick gigs, then lets them generate a Spotify playlist based on the events they select.</p>
